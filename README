prescons.py

This is a "pseudo-interactive" python interpreter.  I hacked this together
when preparing a presentation that involved some live coding.  It reads code
from an input file and runs it line by line.  You can move through the code by
hitting 'space'.

Suggestions, bug reports, patches welcome at github.com/inglesp/prescons.

Usage:

 $ python prescons.py <filename>

See example.py for an example.

Currently runs only on *nix.
