prescons.py

This is a "pseudo-interactive" python interpreter.  I hacked this together
when preparing a presentation that involved some live coding.  It reads code
from an input file and runs it line by line.  You can move through the code by
hitting 'space'.

You can also switch to (and from) a normal interactive console by pressing
Ctrl-C.  This allows you to inspect, and even make changes to, the console's
namespace in the middle of a presentation.

Suggestions, bug reports, patches welcome at github.com/inglesp/prescons.

Usage:

 $ python prescons.py <filename>

See example.py for an example.

Tested on Posix and Windows, and with pythons 2.7 and 3.2
